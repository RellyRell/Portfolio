# Data Portfolio
Welcome! Thanks for stopping by. I wanted to build out this repo to capture some of my data journey so far. While working with clients and on a few capstones, I've found that data is where I'm meant to be. This work has only reinforced my love for using data to make insightful decisions. Learning BI tools like Power BI and Tableau or even pivot tables on excel has been a game changer. It's helped me convey my findings and insights in a much cleaner fashion. I hope to build out this Data Science Portfolio to showcase new skills and tools I've acquired.
